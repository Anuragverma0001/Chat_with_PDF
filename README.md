📄 Chat with PDF — RAG Application

A lightweight Streamlit-based PDF Question-Answering App powered by LangChain and Google GenAI
(Includes FAISS vector search + multi-PDF support)

🚀 Overview

This project is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) app that allows users to upload multiple PDFs and ask any question related to their content.
The system extracts text, chunks it, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database (FAISS or ChromaDB), and retrieves the most relevant context to generate accurate answers using Google Generative AI.

✨ Features

📚 Upload multiple PDFs

🔍 Fast semantic search using FAISS / ChromaDB

🧩 Smart text chunking + embedding generation

⚙️ Environment-configurable with .env

📁 Modular LangChain-based pipeline
